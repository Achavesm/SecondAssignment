# TODO

To complete this assignment, write a class, **BankImpl** than implements the interface **Bank**. Bank accounts must have an owner (titular) and balance (saldo). 

Bank accounts can be of two types: Credit bank accounts and Cash bank accounts. But while cash bank accounts can *NOT* have a negative balance, credit banks accounts *CAN*. 

Write your own tests in order to check the performance of every method.

You may work in teams of **two** or **three** people, but it will be a **personal delivery** due on Friday the 6th of October 2017.

Happy coding!!!
